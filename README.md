# loss-surfaces-of-gans
Code to accompany the paper "A spin glass model for the loss surfaces of generative adversarial networks".

Python notebooks are found in `notebooks` and will generate all plots in the paper. 

Many of the experiments were performed on an HPC with GPU nodes and `scripts` contains bash and Python scripts to run all of these experiments and save the results which are then used in the notebooks. The bash scripts will require minor system-specific modifications to work on your machine.
